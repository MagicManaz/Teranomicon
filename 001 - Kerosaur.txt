~~~BIO~~~
"Small reptillian Teraforms known for their abilty to create small explosions strong enough to knock Teraforms and objects of similar sizes several feet away. Many have began to call
Kerosaur "Walking Death Wishes" for anyone dumb enough to try and tame one, since that tends to end in an attack from their mothers, missing limbs, or even missing people."
